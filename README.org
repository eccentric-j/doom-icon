* DOOM Icon
A project to track my campaign for creating a fancy [[github:hlissner/doom-emacs][Doom Emacs]] icon.

#+CAPTION:  Current draft of proposed Emacs Doom icon
[[./doom.png]]

** Inspiration
After spending the past 10 days learning Emacs Doom, I've been really enjoying
learning more about emacs, org, doom, and especially emacs-lisp.
It's no longer intimidating! When installing [[github:d12frosted/homebrew-emacs-plus][Emacs Plus]] it comes
(or at least, it used to) come with the Spacemacs icon.
It looks good, but it's just not Doom. This is Doom.

The game Doom inspired the emacs hacker [[https://github.com/hlissner][Henrik Lissner]] so naturally a cacodemon felt like the most interesting source to draw from and now here we are.

** What's next?
*** TODO Collect feedback
Make alterations, refine shapes, fix any bad resizes
*** TODO Try digitally painting a version
Can pull more life, texture, and structure out of the character
*** TODO Try 3D modeling a version
Seems like good practice for Blender's sculpting tools


** Goals
- Create a PR for emacs-plus :package:
- Push myself creatively :art:
- Have fun :sunglasses:


** Questions
*** How do I use this icon?
- Download https://raw.githubusercontent.com/eccentric-j/doom-icon/master/doom.png
**** On OS X
- Open doom.png in preview
- Copy it into your clipboard
- Get info on your Emacs App in Finder
- Click on the icon on the top right to highlight it
- Paste with =cmd+v=
[[./howto-use-icon.gif]]
**** Linux
#+BEGIN_SRC
ICON="$HOME/.local/share/icons/doom.png"
DESKTOP_FILE=/usr/local/share/applications/emacs.desktop
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/eccentric-j/doom-icon/master/doom.png -O "$ICON" &&
sudo --preserve-env=ICON,DESKTOP_FILE sed -i "s|Icon=.*|Icon=$ICON|" $DESKTOP_FILE
#+END_SRC
(Thanks to [[https://github.com/drchsl][@drchsl]])
**** Windows
- Download [[http://angusj.com/resourcehacker/#download][Resource Hacker]]
- Use [[https://convertico.com/][this]] site to convert the PNG you want to an ICO
- Save in a useful place

The below section should be replicated for both =emacs.exe= and =emacsclientw.exe=

***** Replace icon for exe
- Locate your emacs install directory (depends on if it has been installer with =choco= or the official installer)
- Open Resource Hacker
- Drag the exe into the window
- Left click on "Icon" on the left tree
- Right click -> Replace icon
- Locate the ICO file from before
- Replace
- Save

*** Want feedback?
Awesome. Feel free to reach out to me on the Doom discord or create an issue on this repo. I love design-centric feedback, "By changing X, it will improve Y because Z". I'll do my best with other feedback, but unless there's some sense of majority opinion in favor of it, it's at my discretion to try or not. But I recognize I'm by no means a spectacular designer so I know there's room for improvement so I'm sure any feedback will help.
*** Since you shared the sources would you be open to PRs with improvements?
Very yes!
*** So you're trying to make this hideous thing the default\official Doom Emacs Icon?
Nope. It would be great if it was an additional option for builds like Emacs Plus.
*** What if I'm seeing the icon and I hate it. I even kinda hate you a little bit for even making it?
That's pretty brutal comrade. But if you feel that way, it is what it is.
*** Are you really going recreate as a digital painting and 3D model it?
Ideally yes! I have some experience with both those mediums and it seems like a fun project. If feedback mostly comes in like my imaginary enemy above, then I may drop the project. Once again, feedback helps a lot here!
*** How do I convert the iconset folder into an =icns= file?
#+BEGIN_SRC
iconutil -c icns ./doom.iconset
#+END_SRC
*** How come you used Adobe Illustrator and Adobe XD instead of other open-source projects?
That's what I like, that's what I'm used to. If you would like to create a PR to swap them out for something open-source I'm all for it. As long as I can still edit it in my tools of choice I see no issue with that.
*** Do you feel you're maybe overthinking this?
Yes! Yes I probably am.
